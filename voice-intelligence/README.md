<h1 align="center">Voice Intelligence Breakout ðŸ§ </h1>

For this breakout you will create a transcript for a pre-recorded phone call, add meta data about the call, and view the level of confidence of your language operators applied to your conversation.

# Twilio Console Setup
If you don't have a pre-recorded converation, create one with a friend or the person sitting next to you. If you're calling a friend outside of the room, we recommend giving them a headsup that the line will be recorded ðŸ˜‰

## Create a Twilio Account
If you haven't done so already, [create a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and navigate to the voice Intelligence page
## Record a call
Follow this [blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/make-receive-calls-twilio-number-using-studio) to buy a Twilio number and set up a call forwarding feature. This way your Twilio number will be the one contacting your partner. 

When setting up the "Connect Call To" widget, make sure call recording is toggled to the `ON` position.

Publish your flow, assign it to a Twilio number, and you're ready to make your call!

## Create a Voice Intelligence service in the Twilio console
Head to the Twilio console and navigate to [Voice Intelligence/Services](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/voice-intelligence/services). Create a new Service and give it a unique name.
All selections when creating a service are optional.

After your service is created, select any prebuilt language operators provided by Twilio and create any language operators you'd like to include.

*Make sure you setup your service to transcribe all recorded calls*

## Make a phone call and test your operator

Make a phone call and say a few words. It does help to think about a use case to help you pick your operators. Then find your transcript in the Voice Intelligence Console

## Stretch Goal

Setup a webhook or Twilio Function to handle the information from the transcript once you're finished
