# Segment Build Session

Introducing the "Segment Build Session" repository, accompanying the dynamic and interactive session held during Signal London 2023! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers seeking to learn how to use Segment.

You have two options. You can:
- Work through a self guided excercise where you will learn how to implement Segment into a business's website. (RECOMMENDED)
- Rebuild the Segment Demo from today's presentation! 


## Self Guided Practical Excercise - RECOMMENDED

Imagine you're a developer for a marketplace called Anythink. One of your co-workers has a new task for you. Work through this story as you implement Twilio Segment for this fictional marketplace.
